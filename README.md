## Project Description

My roommate, Schquita, had a really interesting observation. Is poverty rate correlated with the number of Waffle Houses?

## Tools

To do this I used 

+ `python` for the analysis
+ `beautifulSoup` for webscrapping
+ `PostGIS` for the spatial queries
+ `ogr2ogr` to convert map file types
+ `mapshaper` to reduce the size of the map
+ and finally, `CartoDB` for hosting and displaying the map

Analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/minh5/wafflehouse/blob/master/analysis.ipynb)
and the map can be found [here](http://cdb.io/1Gf9W16)!
